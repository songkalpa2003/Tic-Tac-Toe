# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game developed by myself using C. It is a simple game in which you play against the computer. It does not have a GUI so you will have to play in the console of whatever IDE you are using. The player will be using X and the computer will be using O, the player will be asked where they would like to place their move each time in the 3 x 3 matrix until either the player wins or the computer wins or if it ends in a tie.
